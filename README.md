# Course Project for the Getting And Cleaning Data Course (Coursera)

## Description

This software obtains a dataset from the following link: 


## Implementation

The implementation of this software has been done using the R programming language. Details about the steps taken to process the dataset as described before can be found in the form of detailed comments throughout the code in the file run_analysis.R.

## Usage

The programmed script does all the required steps to obtain the tidy dataset, including the downloading of the data to the current working directory. Simply execute the script by executing the following in the R console:

source('run_analysis.R')
tidy_dataset <- run_analysis()

Now tidy_dataset contains the tidy dataset as required in the instructions of the Course Project.
