## Feature description

Find below the description of the features captured within this dataset. Note that many feature descriptions, specified as "METRIC"X/Y/Z, actually represent 3 independent features captured for the X, Y and Z axis. The mean values of the described signals have been calculated for each subject (specified by the Subject column) and for each activity (specified by the Activity column) it performs.
